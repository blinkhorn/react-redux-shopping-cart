# Super Simple Shopping Cart in Redux

We're going to build a very simple shopping cart that you can add items to. The complexity of the shopping cart app itself is minimal so as to help us get a feel for integrating Redux into a React app.

## Setup

Fork and clone down this repo.

By now, you should have `create-react-app` installed on your computer via `npm`.

<details>
<summary><strong>

</strong></summary>

<br>

Run the following command...

```bash
 $ npm i -g create-react-app
```
</details>

<br>

```bash
 $ create-react-app shopping-cart
 $ npm i -S redux react-redux
```

## Project Structuring

After we've installed these dependencies, let's create directories for `actions`, `components`, `reducers` and `stylesheets` in the `src` directory.

```bash
 $ mkdir src/actions src/components src/reducers src/stylesheets
 $ mv src/App.js src/components/App.js
 $ mv src/App.css src/stylesheets/App.css
 $ mv src/index.css src/stylesheets/index.css
```

Next, let's update the import paths for `App` in `index.js` to reflect the new locations of `App.js` and `App.css`.

Finally, we'll update the path for `index.css` in `index.js`.

## Adding a Store

The first step we'll take in integrating Redux with React will be to define a store using `createStore` from `redux`.

`createStore` will take 2 arguments: the program's combined reducers (`rootReducer`) and an initial state. Recall that a store processes changes in application state with reducers. The store takes in a state, then applies the appropriate **action** via the **reducer**.

Next we'll create a file that defines our store, titled `Store.js`...

```bash
 $ touch src/Store.js
```

in `src/Store.js`...

```js
import {createStore} from 'redux'
import rootReducer from './reducers/RootReducer'

export default (initialState)=>{
  return createStore(rootReducer, initialState)
}
```

Ultimately, a store uses the reducer to apply an action to a state, or more specifically, to a copy of the state.

Stores use **reducers** to determine which change – or action – to apply to the current application state. - An action defines what change needs to take place as well as any data required to make that change
- The reducer executes the change described in the action

## Adding in Reducers

```bash
 $ touch src/reducers/RootReducer.js src/reducers/CartReducers.js
```

### Using `combineReducers`

The `combineReducers` helper function returns a single, aggregated object. As its name suggests, `combineReducers` combines all the reducers into a single object, then returns that object.

We will refer to the returned object as `rootReducer` below. The values of `rootReducer` will be the reducer functions combined into a single reducing function you can pass to `createStore`.

In `src/reducers/RootReducer.js`...

```js
import cart from './CartReducers'
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

// the object returned by this function must have a key named `cart` since `cart`
// will be a *prop* on our Cart component
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  cart //ES6 short hand for {cart: cart}
})

export default rootReducer
```

In `src/reducers/CartReducers.js`...

```js
export default(state = [], action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return [...state, action.item]
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      let newCart = [...state];
      newCart.splice(action.item, 1);
      return newCart;
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

> [Switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) statement conditionals are used in place of `if`/`else if` conditionals
because they read more cleanly.

## Adding an Action

```bash
 $ touch src/actions/CartActions.js
```

In `src/actions/CartActions.js`...

```js
// Action Creator function
// This action will be called from a button in the UI
export const addToCart = (item) => {

  // This console.log is a side effect and technically makes this function 'impure'.
  // It may come in handy when testing to see if we've integrated redux successfully,
  // to determine if our actions are firing

  console.log(`ACTION: adding ${item} to cart`)
  return {
    //actions must have a type property
    type: 'ADD_ITEM', //action naming conventions: all caps with snake-case (JAVASCRIPT_CONSTANT naming convention )
    item //ES6 shorthand again {item: item}
  }
}

export const removeFromCart = (item) => {
  console.log(`ACTION: Removing ${item} from cart`)
  return {
    type: 'REMOVE_ITEM',
    item
  }
}
```

## Adding a Shelf Component

```bash
 $ touch src/components/Shelf.js
```

In `src/components/Shelf.js`...

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Shelf extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      shelfItems: [
        "Bananas",
        "Frozen Pizza",
        "Flamin' Hot Cheetos",
        "Arugula"
      ]
    }
  }

  render() {
    const shelfItems = this.state.shelfItems.map( (item, id) => {
      return (
        <li key={id}>
          {item}
          <button onClick={() => this.props.addItem(item)}>+</button>
        </li>
      )
    })
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Store Inventory</h2>
        <ul>
            {shelfItems}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Shelf
```

## Adding a Cart Component

Before we continue coding, let's talk about how Redux interacts with container components and presentational components differently.

> From [Redux Docs: Presentational and Container Components](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html#presentational-and-container-components)

> Technically you could write the container components by hand using store.subscribe(). We don't advise you to do this because React Redux makes many performance optimizations that are hard to do by hand. For this reason, rather than write container components, we will generate them using the connect() function provided by React Redux, as you will see below.

![Comparing container components and presentational components in Redux](./lesson-images/redux-presentational-container-diffs.png)

> [Here's another resource from Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

```bash
 $ touch src/components/Cart.js
```

In `src/components/Cart.js`...

```js
import React from 'react'
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'

import * as CartActions from '../actions/CartActions'
import Shelf from '../components/Shelf'

const Cart = (props) => {
  let cartItems = props.cart.map((item, id) => {
    return (
      <li key={id}>
        {item}
        <button onClick={() => props.actions.removeFromCart(id)}>-</button>
      </li>
    )
  })
  return (
    <div>
      <Shelf addItem={props.actions.addToCart}/>
      <h2>Cart</h2>
      <ol>
        {cartItems}
      </ol>
    </div>
  )
}

// More information about the implementation pattern below can be found at the link below
// https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options

// Subscribes the component to any changes in Redux-managed state (the store)
// the Store's state is being mapped to, or passed into, the components as props
function mapStoreStateToComponentProps(state, props) {
  return {
    cart: state.cart
  };
}

// Changes in our program will be reflected when new actions are dispatched to the reducer
function mapDispatchToComponentProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    actions: bindActionCreators(CartActions, dispatch)
  }
}

// typically the lines below would be condensed into :
// export default connect(mapStoreStateToComponentProps, mapDispatchToComponentProps)(Cart)

// returns a function wrapper that we need to pass the component into
const wrapperFunction = connect(mapStoreStateToComponentProps, mapDispatchToComponentProps)

// wraps the Cart component with the store connection configured above
const wrappedComponent = wrapperFunction(Cart)

export default wrappedComponent

```

In `mapStoreStateToComponentProps`, we're passing in `props` but not using it. The `Cart` component will only be receiving props from redux.

Next, we'll head over to `App.js` to add in our new component.

  <summary><strong>
    When do you need access to props?
  </strong></summary>

  If we had some kind of information in `props` that was pertinent to the state.
  In the example below, our `props` corresponds to `ownProps`.

  > We are calling `mapStateToProps` `mapStoreStateToComponentProps` in this exercise so that the function's purpose is more clear

## Adding Cart to App Component

In `components/App.js`...

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import Cart from '../components/Cart'

import '../stylesheets/App.css'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Cart />
    );
  }
}

export default App
```

## Adding App Component to Application Root (`index.js`)


```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
// The Provider is a special type of component.
// The Provider will wrap our App component along with a store that encapsulates
// local states within the App component.

import App from './components/App'
import Store from './Store'

const StoreInstance = Store()

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={StoreInstance}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

## Adding Integration with Chrome Redux Devtools Extension

In `src/Store.js`...

```js
export default(initialState) => {
  return createStore(
    rootReducer,
    initialState,
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
  )
}
```
Now you should be able to see state changes reflected in Redux Devtools!
